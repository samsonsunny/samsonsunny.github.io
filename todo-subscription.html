Setmore Appointments - Subscription Policy
Setmore is a free online scheduling platform that offers advanced features with a Setmore Premium subscription. When adding a Setmore Premium subscription to your account, you may choose between a monthly billing period of $24.99 USD per month, or an annual billing period of $199.99 USD per year.

By upgrading to Setmore Premium, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.


Subscription Period
Your billing cycle begins the day you sign up. If you chose the monthly billing period, your subscription will renew automatically each month, from the day you signed up. If you chose the annual billing period, your subscription will renew automatically each year, from the day you signed up.

Multiple Staff
The free, basic version of Setmore allows up to 4 staff profiles/calendars in one account. Using the staff login feature, staff members can create a username and password to access their calendar on your account. Setmore Premium also allows up to 20 staff profiles/calendars.

When you upgrade to Setmore Premium, all members of your account will have access to Setmore Premium features.

The account admin who upgraded to Setmore Premium will manage the subscription settings for the entire account using their Apple ID on their iOS device. Any staff member who did not upgrade to Setmore Premium will not be able to access subscription settings, but they will have access to Setmore Premium features for the duration of the subscription.


Cancellation
You may cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, your subscription will continue until the end of the current billing period, and your subscription will not automatically renew. You will continue to have access to Setmore Premium features until your billing period elapses.

Features
Setmore Premium includes all the features of the basic, free version of Setmore, including: an online calendar where you can book appointments with customers; multiple staff profiles and calendars in a single account; automatic email confirmations and reminders; a free, customizable, online Booking Page where customers can schedule appointments with your business anytime; a free Square integration that lets you take payments for appointments online; and more.

Setmore Premium adds the following features:

Up to 20 staff members: The free, basic version of Setmore only supports up to 4 staff profiles and calendars in a single account. With Setmore Premium, you can raise this limit to 20 staff profiles and calendars.

Text reminders: One text reminder will automatically send to your customer at a set duration before each appointment.

2-way calendar sync: Automatically export your Setmore appointments and events to your Google or Office 365 account, and import your Google or Office 365 events to your Setmore calendar.

Online payments with Stripe: The free version of Setmore allows you to integrate your Square account. Setmore Premium will allow you to integrate your Stripe account for an additional payment provider option.

Recurring appointments and classes: Schedule a whole series of appointments or class sessions with just a few taps.

White-label Booking Page: Remove the Setmore brand header and footer from your Booking Page, so that customers will only see your company logo and branding.


Managing Auto-Renewal
Your Setmore Premium subscription will renew automatically at the start of your billing cycle. If your payment method expires or elapses, your access to Setmore Premium features may be temporarily suspended until your payment method is updated.

You may view your subscription settings and billing history for Setmore Premium using your iOS device's Settings menu:

1. Open Settings and tap on your Apple ID name card at the top of the menu.

2. Tap on iTunes & App Store, then tap your Apple ID at the top of the screen.

3. Select "View Apple ID" and then tap Subscriptions.

4. Select Setmore Appointments to access your subscription settings.

The subscription settings menu will allow you to cancel your Setmore Premium subscription, or change between a monthly/yearly billing period. If you change your billing period, the change will take effect when the current billing period ends:

If you change your billing period from monthly to yearly, your subscription payment of $199.99 USD will automatically bill at the end of the current month that your billing period is in, and every year thereafter until cancellation.
If you change your billing period from yearly to monthly, your subscription payment of $24.99 USD will automatically bill at the end of the current year that your billing period is in, and every month thereafter until cancellation.
Setmore does not maintain, store, or share payment information for subscribers who upgrade to Setmore Premium using their Apple ID from an iOS device. Payments are processed by Apple and subscription information is tied to the user's Apple ID.


Setmore Not Listed Under Subscriptions
If you don't see Setmore listed under your Apple ID subscriptions, it may be because you are a staff member for the account or that another member on your account upgraded to Setmore Premium using their Apple ID. The Setmore user who originally upgraded to Setmore Premium is the only user who may change or update the subscription settings.

You will also be unable to see Setmore under your Apple ID subscriptions if you upgraded to Setmore Premium through a web browser at https://my.setmore.com. If you or another account admin upgraded to Setmore Premium in this way, then you can manage your subscription settings through our web browser login at https://my.setmore.com rather than your iOS device.
